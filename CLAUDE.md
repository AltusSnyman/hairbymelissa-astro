# Hair By Melissa - Project Context & Memory

## Project Overview
Hair By Melissa is an Astro v5.13.0 static site for a premium hair salon in Kaukapakapa, Auckland, New Zealand. The site specializes in SEO optimization, image optimization, and Core Web Vitals improvements.

## Recent Major Work Completed

### ✅ Image Optimization Implementation (Complete)
**Objective:** Convert all images to WebP format, implement lazy loading, improve Core Web Vitals scores (especially LCP) for SEO benefits.

**Status:** FULLY COMPLETED ✅

**Key Achievements:**
- Downloaded 19 unique images from Google Storage (1.6GB total)
- Generated 304 optimized files (152 WebP + 152 JPEG fallbacks)
- Updated 104 image references across 27+ files
- Implemented advanced lazy loading with IntersectionObserver
- Created responsive image sets (320px-1920px breakpoints)
- Added performance tracking and error handling

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/public/images/optimized/` - 304 optimized image files
- `/src/utils/imageMap.ts` - Image mapping system
- `/src/components/OptimizedImage.astro` - Responsive image component
- `/src/styles/image-optimization.css` - Lazy loading CSS
- `/src/scripts/image-optimization.js` - Advanced ImageOptimizer class
- `update-image-references.js` - Automated URL replacement script
- Updated `robots.txt` for image crawling

### ✅ Gallery Thumbnail Display Fix (Complete)
**Issue:** Gallery thumbnails displayed as black screens due to CSS opacity conflicts.

**Root Cause:** Image optimization lazy loading CSS was setting `opacity: 0` without proper restoration for gallery images.

**Resolution:** Completely removed opacity-based lazy loading for gallery images:
- Changed gallery images from `loading="lazy"` to `loading="eager"`
- Added `!important` CSS overrides for immediate display
- Preserved hover effects (scale transform)
- Maintained lightbox functionality

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/styles/image-optimization.css` - Removed opacity effects for gallery
- `/src/pages/gallery.astro` - Changed to eager loading

## Development Notes

### Image References Update
All Google Storage URLs have been systematically replaced with local optimized images:
- Pattern: `https://storage.googleapis.com/msgsndr/...` → `/images/optimized/[name]_[size].webp`
- Automated with custom script updating 104 references across codebase
- Includes proper alt text and responsive sizing

### Core Web Vitals Focus
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** Critical image prioritization
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Aspect ratio containers
- **FID (First Input Delay):** Non-blocking image loading

### Browser Compatibility
- WebP with JPEG fallbacks for older browsers
- IntersectionObserver with immediate loading fallback
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements
- Consider adding Playwright MCP for cross-browser testing
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- A/B testing for Core Web Vitals improvements
- Additional image format support (AVIF)

## Emergency Rollback
If image optimization causes issues:
1. Revert to original Google Storage URLs in imageMap.ts
2. Remove image-optimization.css imports
3. Disable ImageOptimizer script loading
