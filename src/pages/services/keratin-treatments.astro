  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is Keratin Treatment? Your Solution for Frizz-Free Hair in Auckland</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    Keratin treatment is a semi-permanent hair smoothing process that fills in the porosity of your hair, as overly porous hair causes tangles, frizz, and breakage. The treatment works by applying a keratin product to your hair, which is then sealed in with the heat of a flat iron. This process smooths the hair cuticle and eliminates frizz, leaving you with manageable, glossy hair.
